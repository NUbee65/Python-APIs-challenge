    "### Observable Trends in the Data\n",
    "* We sampled the 100 most recent tweets for each of the news organizations (at virtually the same time across the news organiations) multiple times over the span of a couple days, and each time we then calculated their compound sentiment analysis scores.  What was somewhat surprising is that sentiment toward each news organization remained pretty much in line relative to other news organizations for the couple day period we measured sentiment.  \n",
    "* We were also surprised by the fact that periodically, many of Fox News tweets tended to include little or no commentary and seemed to prefer to rely more on the web links to articles (presumably) by themselves.  It's not clear whether that aspect presents an issue in calibrating sentiment analysis, since Fox is effecting letting the links speak for themselves, and the Vadar sentimenet analysis does not hunt down the links.\n",
    "* We also noted that Fox News seems to have a slower tweet schedule than the other news organizations, about half as fast from the samples we examined.  We speculate this may have something to do with the news organization perhaps drawing a line between the news reporting organization and the news commentary organization.  It could also be that its news reporters and/or commentators use independent twitter accounts, for a variety of reasons (e.g., brand protection).\n",
    "* Not surprisingly, we also observed that tweets sometimes clustered in time and occasionally in sentiment, certainly reflecting the news cycle, the particular bias/orientation of each news organization, the preferences of each news organization's viewer base, and also likely breaking story sentiment (e.g., major events).  It is worth pointing out that bias is reflected not only adding one's slant to the news but also the choice of which stories to report or comment on.\n",
    "* Lastly, had we normalized the x-axis timeline, we might have seen similar parallel clustering between news organizations based on the news cycle, bias, and geographic orientation (e.g., BBC)."
